- 👋 Hello, I am Silvestre López Romano, I graduated from the Computer Engineering degree from the Autonomous University of Tlaxcala. 
  I have experience in the Unity game engine, especially in creating apps for mobile devices with C # integrating VR with Vuforia, creating 3D models with blender and Maya.
- 👀 I am interested in projects related to virtual reality and augmented reality, both for mobile devices and web applications.
- 🌱 Currently I am learning the use of shaders for 3D modeling and creation of photorealistic textures to integrate realism to my models.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate with app development teams with AR, VR and 3D modeling.
